This project is a responsive landing page created as part of my portfolio.

The main goal of the project was to practice building a clean layout based on a design, using semantic HTML, SCSS, and responsive techniques.

The page is fully responsive and optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

During development, I focused on clean code structure, reusable SCSS components, and proper file organization.

This project demonstrates my ability to create responsive layouts and prepare a project for production and portfolio use.
