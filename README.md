## 📖 Description
The main goal of the project was to practice building a clean layout based on a design, using semantic HTML, SCSS, and responsive techniques. 
The page is fully responsive and optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. 
During development, I focused on clean code structure, reusable SCSS components, and proper file organization. 
This project demonstrates my ability to create responsive layouts and prepare a project for production and portfolio use.
